# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains three tasks involving data analysis and machine learning using Python. The tasks are:

1. **Linear Regression Analysis on Student Scores Data**
2. **K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Dataset**

## Task 1: Linear Regression Analysis on Student Scores Data

### Objective
The objective of this task is to predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they studied using linear regression.

### Steps
1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.
2. **Load Data**:
   - Load the dataset from a URL and display the first 15 rows.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plot the data to visualize the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained.
4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Split the data into features (hours) and target (scores).
5. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Training**:
   - Train a linear regression model on the training data.
7. **Model Visualization**:
   - Plot the regression line with the data points.
8. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions on the test data.
9. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the actual and predicted scores.
   - Calculate and display the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Output
- A scatter plot of hours vs. scores.
- A line plot of the regression line.
- A comparison of actual and predicted scores.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value.

### Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Task 2: K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

### Objective
The objective of this task is to perform clustering on the Iris dataset to identify different species of Iris flowers.

### Steps
1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.
2. **Load Data**:
   - Load the Iris dataset and display the first 5 rows.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Extract the feature variables from the dataset.
4. **Elbow Method**:
   - Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. **Model Training**:
   - Train a K-Means clustering model with the optimal number of clusters.
6. **Cluster Visualization**:
   - Visualize the clusters and their centroids.

### Output
- A plot showing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- A scatter plot visualizing the clusters and centroids.

### Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Dataset

### Objective
The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset to gain insights into sales, profit, and other key metrics.

### Steps
1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. **Load Data**:
   - Load the dataset and display the first 5 rows.
3. **Data Overview**:
   - Display summary statistics and check for missing values.
4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicate entries from the dataset.
5. **Overall Profit/Loss Analysis**:
   - Calculate and display the overall profit/loss of the business.
6. **Category-wise Analysis**:
   - Analyze profit/loss and sales by different categories.
7. **Region-wise Analysis**:
   - Analyze profit/loss and sales by different regions.
8. **Sub-Category Analysis**:
   - Analyze profit/loss by different sub-categories.
9. **Discount Analysis**:
   - Analyze the impact of discount on profit/loss.
10. **Shipping Mode Analysis**:
    - Analyze sales and profit by different shipping modes.
11. **Segment Analysis**:
    - Analyze sales and profit by different customer segments.
12. **State-wise Analysis**:
    - Analyze sales and profit by different states.
13. **Recommendations**:
    - Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

### Output
- Various bar plots, pie charts, and line plots visualizing the analysis.
- Summary of overall profit/loss.
- Recommendations for improving business performance.

### Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
